/// Backend-neutral client for a single media server (Plex or Jellyfin).
///
/// Each implementation wraps the per-backend HTTP layer and exposes the same
/// operations the rest of the app needs to browse libraries, mark watch

///
/// ## Naming

/// Read methods use a `fetch*` prefix. Backend-specific operations that do not

/// `rate`, `createPlaylist`, `addToPlaylist`, `deletePlaylist`,
/// `movePlaylistItem`, `removeFromPlaylist`, `createCollection`,
/// `addToCollection`, `removeFromCollection`, `deleteCollection`,
/// `deleteMediaItem`) follow the same contract:
///
///   - HTTP 4xx/5xx → throw [MediaServerHttpException].
///   - Network/IO failure → throw the underlying exception.
///   - Business "not applicable" (e.g. wrong-backend item handed to a
///     write call) → return `false` without throwing.
///   - Success → return the created entity / `true`.
///
/// `fetchItem` returns `null` on a real 404 (item gone) and on a 200 that
/// can't be parsed; auth/server errors throw rather than silently dropping
/// to `null`.
///
/// Callers that need to differentiate "operation impossible" from "server
/// error" should `try`/`catch` the result and inspect the exception's
/// `statusCode`.

/// rejected) from a generic transport failure, so the manager can route the
/// two states to different UI ("Sign in again" vs "Server offline").
